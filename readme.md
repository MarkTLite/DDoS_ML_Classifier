# DDoS Attack Prediction Web App

## Brief Description
Input values from a network such as Packet Count, Received bytes for the machine learning based model to detect Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attacks.

These inputs are passed to a pipeline of SVM, logistic regression, Naive Bayes and KNN and their predictions along with the data are finally fed to a Random Forest Classifier.
